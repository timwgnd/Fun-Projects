Just some fun projects, I've been working on in the past. My favorite is:

# The Tic Tac Toe-Project
#### 1. Human vs. Human: Text-based Approach
#### 2. Human vs. Human: Pygame GUI
#### 3. Human vs. Computer: Hard-coded Strategies
#### 4. Human vs. Computer: Reinforcement Learning


Images for Tic Tac Toe with pygame GUI can be downloaded here (just adapt the path in the code to where you store the images):
